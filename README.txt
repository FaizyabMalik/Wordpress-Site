Purpose
-----------

Show Workflow which consist of all working steps required to design , implement and deploy a website . Developed a ePortfolio in local environment and then deploy to a live site. For this ePortfolio Wordpress was used in a local environment to design the site as it provided necessary tools to implement without having to face many problems.

-----------------
Background
-----------------
Purpose of the ePortfolio is for my skills and experience to be showcased online in dealing with the current competitive job market.

--------------------
Design Decisions 
--------------------

Firstly MoSCow technique was used to figure out the must have , should have , could have and would have were for the portfolio design and features .

Then to get the design of the site decision I spent making many sketches on a blank paper to come up with a wireframe of all the initial 5 MVP pages ( Home , About me , Achievements , Blog and Resume).

Decided the achievement page will also include  the work I have done during my study period as they can also be  considered an achievement.

For the features ( plugins etc. ) that were to be used within the portfolio the card sorting technique was used where 40-50 cards had ideas on them but only a few were selected as they made sense with the site . ( This is shown in the word document attached) .

As for the content to be deployed to showcase my work a few were selected and the explanation of what the work is about is given in one line sentence  also shown in the word document attached .


Simple ready made design was used from Wordpress as it matched the the sketches of the site.

Review of the assignment
-----------------------------------------------------
Around 20-30 hours spent on this assignment which includes the word document showcasing the various design issues made  as well as gathering of the information . The work was done by myself and no collaboration or discussion took place with anyone. The assignment has allowed me to deploy an ePortfolio site which I can add to into the future when I complete further work . It has shown be how an ePortfolio works and how I can showcase my skills to future employers. The main aspect is that it has showed me how the deployment model works in most work environments.
works .
